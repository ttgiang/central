   3. An online summary of curricular actions each semester, listing the approved proposals (alpha) by department/discipline for ease in finding related proposals. The chart should include date of final action (chancellor approval) and what the proposal was. For example: Modification of prerequisites, Modification of credits, Modification of description, New course, New program, or etc.  The proposals on the summary chart would be linked to the "final, signed, approved" proposal only. This chart would be for final, approved proposals and not what the curriculum committee or FS need for their review process.

		Hi Thanh,
		Here is the verbage and links from our Curriculum Website where faculty must check first if they are proposing a new course.

		2. The first step for new courses is to check the most recent list of Active Courses in the UH System to determine which alphas and numbers are in use. If the new course you are proposing is the same as another course in the system, use that alpha and number. You may also search the entire list at UHCC Master Course List.

		UH Community College Master Course List:

		University of Hawaii Master Course List (Active courses in the UH system):
